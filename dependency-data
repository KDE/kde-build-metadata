# This is a listing of build order dependencies for some of the KDE project
# modules. See the README in this same directory for the syntax. Not all
# inter-project dependencies are listed so don't treat this as the
# authoritative source, instead consult projects' CMakeLists.txt files.
#
# Of course feel free to document your own project dependencies here, but
# please limit to intra-projects dependencies (there's not yet any way to mark
# a dependency on something hosted on e.g. gitorious).
#
# Right now there's no way to mark that a given module is actually required or
# optional, that might change in the future.
#
# Don't bother listing kdelibs or Qt as dependencies unless a certain branch
# is needed.

# Note: This can possibly be removed around 2012-12-31 assuming enough kdesrc-build
