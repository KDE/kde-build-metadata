This repository contains various metadata to be used by build scripts to support proper
building of KDE projects.

As I currently envision it, this will at least do the following:

1. Mark repositories that should not be downloaded, built or otherwise handled
by build scripts but are actually active (the big example being -www
directories which simply hold websites).

This will be held in the file 'build-script-ignore', which will be just a
newline-separated list of KDE Project path names to ignore, as given in the
<path> tag under <component>, <module>, etc.

2. Give dependency data to show which KDE project modules depend on other ones,
so that sub-projects of a given project can still be built in the right order
no matter how they are arranged in the XML database.

I would imagine this will be in the file 'dependency-data', which would have a
newline-separated list of KDE Project path names to KDE Project path name
dependencies, in Makefile format.

e.g.

extragear/kdevelop/kdevelop: extragear/kdevelop/kdevplatform
extragear/kdevelop/utilities/*: extragear/kdevelop/kdevelop

(A wildcard format would be permissible to force all modules in that XML path
to develop on some module $foo (except $foo itself, if $foo happens to be in
that set)).

However I still haven't coded this or fully fleshed it out, and I need to
consult with Michael Jansen to see what he could use or would need for his
kde-build Ruby script.

At some point comments should be supported in both files, but I haven't coded anything
special for that yet in kdesrc-build.

Syntax:

<path_specifier>[<branch>]: <path_specifier>[<branch>]

<path_specifier> on the right hand side might be prefixed with "-" to indicate that
that dependency is not valid for the given project and branch.
